      "answer": "Answer:\nSocial scoring by AI systems, whether conducted by public or private actors, is prohibited under the EU AI Act due to the potential for discriminatory outcomes and violations of rights such as dignity and non-discrimination. Such systems evaluate or classify individuals based on various data points related to their social behavior and personal characteristics, which can lead to detrimental treatment of individuals or groups in contexts unrelated to the original data collection. The Act explicitly states that unacceptable scoring practices that result in such outcomes should be prohibited, although lawful evaluations for specific purposes in accordance with Union and national law are not affected by this prohibition [EUAI_Rec31_Chunk0].\n\nSources:\n- [EUAI_Rec31_Chunk0]",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "answer": "Answer:\nHigh-risk AI systems must adhere to several requirements as outlined in the EU AI Act. These include the establishment of a risk management system that is documented and maintained throughout the lifecycle of the AI system. This system involves a continuous process of identifying, estimating, and evaluating risks related to health, safety, and fundamental rights, as well as implementing appropriate risk management measures to mitigate these risks [EUAI_Art9_Chunk0].\n\nAdditionally, high-risk AI systems must ensure technical robustness, meaning they should be resilient against harmful behaviors that may arise from system limitations or environmental factors. This includes implementing technical solutions to prevent or minimize undesirable behavior, such as fail-safe mechanisms [EUAI_Rec75_Chunk0]. \n\nMoreover, comprehensive technical documentation must be maintained, detailing the system's characteristics, capabilities, limitations, and the risk management system itself. This documentation is essential for compliance verification and post-market monitoring [EUAI_Rec71_Chunk0]. \n\nFinally, a quality management system must be in place to ensure compliance with the regulation, which includes systematic actions for design, development, quality control, and data management [EUAI_Rec68_Chunk23].\n\nSources:\n- [EUAI_Art9_Chunk0]\n- [EUAI_Rec75_Chunk0]\n- [EUAI_Rec71_Chunk0]\n- [EUAI_Rec68_Chunk23]",

Providers must ensure that these systems are designed to inform users that they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is already obvious to a reasonably well-informed person, considering the context of use. This requirement does not apply to AI systems authorized by law for criminal justice purposes, unless they are publicly accessible for reporting crimes [EUAI_Art50_Chunk0]. Additionally, outputs from AI systems that generate synthetic content must be marked in a machine-readable format to indicate they are artificially generated or manipulated [EUAI_Art50_Chunk0]. \n\nFurthermore, when AI systems process biometric data to identify or infer emotions or intentions, users must be notified, especially if they belong to vulnerable groups [EUAI_Rec132_Chunk0].

      "answer": "Answer:\nThe EU AI Act classifies AI systems by risk level primarily into high-risk and non-high-risk categories. High-risk AI systems are defined based on their intended purpose and the potential harm they may pose to health, safety, or fundamental rights. Specifically, an AI system is classified as high-risk if it meets two conditions: it is intended to be used as a safety component of a product or is itself a product covered by Union harmonisation legislation, and it requires a third-party conformity assessment for market placement or service provision [EUAI_Art6_Chunk0]. Additionally, certain AI systems listed in Annex III are also considered high-risk unless they do not pose a significant risk of harm [EUAI_Art6_Chunk0]. \n\nFurthermore, AI systems intended to influence electoral outcomes or voting behavior are classified as high-risk, except for those whose outputs do not directly expose individuals [EUAI_Rec62_Chunk0]. The classification methodology is designed to adapt to technological developments and changes in AI usage [EUAI_Rec52_Chunk0].\n\nSources:\n- [EUAI_Art6_Chunk0]\n- [EUAI_Rec62_Chunk0]\n- [EUAI_Rec52_Chunk0]",

This oversight aims to prevent or minimize risks to health, safety, or fundamental rights that may arise when the system is used as intended or under reasonably foreseeable misuse conditions, especially when other safety measures are insufficient [EUAI_Art14_Chunk0].\n\nThe oversight measures must be proportional to the risks, level of autonomy, and context of use of the AI system. These measures can be built into the system by the provider before it is placed on the market or can be identified for implementation by the deployer [EUAI_Art14_Chunk0]. Additionally, the system must enable those assigned to oversee it to understand its capabilities and limitations, monitor its operation, and be aware of potential automation bias [EUAI_Art14_Chunk0].\n\nFurthermore, high-risk AI systems should include mechanisms that guide and inform the overseer on when and how to intervene to avoid negative consequences.
